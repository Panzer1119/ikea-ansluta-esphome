# ikea-ansluta-esphome
IKEA Ansluta integration for Home Assistant using [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) with a D1 Mini and CC2500.

## Hardware required
- ESP8266 or ESP32
- CC2500 transceiver

## Documentation
For installation instructions, component docs, examples and upgrade guides see the [wiki]().
There are also some [example configs here](example/)

### Note about multiple remotes
I'm not sure how well this works with multiple remotes. I only have one remote, so I have no way of testing it.

## Credits
This is based upon the reverse engineering work of [NDBCK](https://github.com/NDBCK/Ansluta-Remote-Controller). 
I have also taken some inspiration from [ksjoberg](https://github.com/ksjoberg/ikea-ansluta-bridge) and [matlen67](https://github.com/matlen67/ansluta-control).
